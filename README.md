>Google Developer Student Club University Malaya Android Development Challenge.

Instead of modifying the current example project, I've chosen to create the application by using Flutter and Firebase (Cloud Firestore). 

  

## Functionalities
- Sign in with Google
- Auto-save eclaire entry
- Auto-detect time of entry
- Rich text auto colorization 
- Update, delete entries
- Emotion based quote generator based on pre-trained text classifier of Tensorflow Lite 
- Entry canvas color picker
  

## UI/Ux
Ideas used from neumorphism + Material UI, inspired by Marie Curie's diary!

## Dependencies
Available publicly in Flutter pub.

- cloud_firestore
